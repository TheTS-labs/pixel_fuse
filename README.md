# PixelFuse
A CLI tool that coverts basically any file into _✨grayscaled gif mess✨_ and vice-versa

## Encode

**PLEASE NOTE: all file content will be placed in RAM**

Run `pixel_fuse encode Cargo.toml Cargo.toml.gif` to get something like that:

<img src="/examples/Cargo.toml.gif" width="250" height="250"/>

Or run it against random file* to get that:

<img src="/examples/random.gif" width="250" height="250"/>

*Random file generated by the command: `head -c 64M /dev/urandom > random`

## Decode

Run `pixel_fuse decode Cargo.toml.gif Cargo.toml.decoded`

During GIF creation, the first frame contains metadata such as file name (not used), frame hash (no meta frame), remaining pixels used to fill the last frame, PixelFuse version and number of frames for the progress bar during decoding

After decoding a hash will be calculated to check the integrity of the file, so if the hash matches you can be sure that everything is the same as it was before encoding.

## Permormance*

Encode and decode runs at ~900 frames per second, the size of the GIF increased by ~0.4 GiB (1.1 GiB > 1.5 GiB)
